            <p>Krishna was the son of the Yadava chief Vasudeva and his mother was Devaki. Hence he was known as Vasudeva Krishna or Vaasudeva.
               Krishna made his entry into the Mahabharata at a later stage – during Draupadi’s swayamvar. He was a silent spectator in Drupad’s court and he watched as kings and princes failed in the challenge set to marry Draupadi. He was still watching as Arjuna, dressed as a Brahmin, won the challenge and took his bride home, much to the chagrin of the royal spectators.

After Arjuna introduced Draupadi to his mother Kunti, Krishna arrived carrying expensive presents for the Pandavas. When Yudhishthira asked the reason for the costly gifts, Krishna replied saying because the glory of the Pandavas had been seen in the court of King Drupad. He was the only one sitting in the swayamvar who recognized that the Brahmins in Drupad’s court were in fact the Pandavas. This is just one example of Krishna’s ability to recognize greatness in the ordinary.

Krishna was a great friend, especially to the Pandavas in their time of need. When the Pandavas came back to Hastinapur after a period of exile, Duryodhana begrudgingly gave them a piece of dry land called Khandavprastha, with no water and infertile soil to rule over. It is with Krishna’s help that the Pandavas converted this land into a beautiful kingdom with a magnificent palace that outshone Duryodhana’s abode.

Krishna’s selflessness came to the fore once more when the Pandavas returned from their second exile of 13 years and a war between them and the Kauravas was now inevitable. Krishna tried to stop the war by going to Duryodhana’s court and asking him to settle his dispute with his cousin brothers amicably, but to no avail.

In the Kurukshetra war, we see Krishna transition from a friend to a philosopher and guide to the Pandavas. Krishna chose to be Arjuna’s charioteer over a more commanding position as he felt he could be more of a help in that role. This help can be seen from the get-go when Arjuna hesitated to fight against his kin at the start of the war. It is Krishna who helped Arjuna realise that duty comes before all else and that this battle was for the greater good. There are several mini-battles in the Kurukshetra war that Arjuna would have surely lost if it hadn’t been for Krishna’s protection.</p>

            <p>Arjun : Arjuna was one of the five Pandava brothers of the Mahabharata epic. He was born to Kunti and and king Pandu with the energy of Indra, the leader of the gods. At a very young age he got acclaim for his sincerity and skill in archery. He was known for his steadfastness and single mindedness in pursuing his goals. He was instrumental in winning Draupadi in a contest for himself and his brothers as their joint wife. He also married Subhadra the sister of Krishna and Balarama and kept his friendship with them for ever. Lord Krishna became his mentor and guide for the rest of his life.
                He was known by different namesm or rather titles, such as Phaalgun, Keerti, Paartha, Savyashachee, Dhanajaya and so on. During his sojourns to far away places in the subcontinent, he married Chitrangada, daughter of the king of Manipur and Ulupi, a naga princess. Two brave warrior sons were born to him. They were Abhimnyu through Subhadra and Bhabhruvahana through Chitrangada. Both his sons played an important role during the Mahabharata war.

                He had a powerful bow by the name Gandiva, which helped him enormously in slaying his enemies. He got it from Varuna, the Vedic god of rain through Agni the god of fire. He also received a divine golden chariot from the latter as a gift which helped him to fight battles with Indra, his godfather and later with the Kauravas his cousins.</p>

        <p>Bheem : In Indian epic Mahabharata, Bhima is the second among the five Pandavas. The Mahabharata relates many events that portray the might of Bhima. Bhima was born when Vayu, the wind god, granted a son to Kunti and Pandu. After the death of Pandu and Madri, Kunti with her sons stayed in Hastinapura. From childhood Bhima had a rocky relationship with his cousins Kauravas, especially Duryodhana. Duryodhana and his uncle, Shakuni, tried to kill Bhima multiple times. One was by poisoning and throwing Bhima into a river. Bhima was rescued by Nāgas and was given a drink which made him very strong and immune to all venom.</p>

        <p> Yudhishtira : In the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, Yudhishtira is the first among the five Pandavas. He was the son of king Pandu of Kuru and his first wife, Kunti and was blessed by death god Yama to the couple. In the epic, he becomes the emperor of Indraprastha and later of Hastinapura (Kuru).

From his childhood, Yudhishthira was greatly influenced by his uncle Vidura and his great - granduncle Bhishma, and believed in Dharma. He was trained in politics by Kripa and spear fighting by Drona. Later, he was appointed as the crowned prince of Hastinapura but was replaced by Duryodhana. Because of Kunti's misunderstanding, Yudhishthira and his brothers were married to Draupadi. Dhritarashtra, on Bhishma's request, divided his kingdom to end the succession dispute between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. The eldest son of Pandu was given a barren land to rule, but he developed the magnificent city of Indraprastha.

After he performed Rajasuya, he became the emperor and was invited to play Pachisi, a game of dice by his jealous cousin, Duryodhana and his uncle, Shakuni. There Yudhishthira gambled his kingdom, fame, wealth, his brothers, Draupadi and even himself. After the game and the Pandavas and Draupadi were sent on an exile for thirteen years. During his exile, he was tested by Yama. For incognito, Yudhishthira disguised himself as Kanka and served the king of Matsya Kingdom.

Yudhishthira was the leader of the successful Pandava side in the Kurukshetra War and defeated many warriors including Shalya. At the end of the epic, he was the only one among his brothers to ascend to heaven with his mortal body. His only sin was a half-lie spoken during the 15th day of the Mahabharata war. He was also blessed with the spiritual vision of second sight by a celestial Rishi as a boon.</p>

        <p>In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Sahadeva  was the youngest of the five Pandava brothers. Nakula and Sahadev were twins born to Madri who had invoked the Ashwini Kumaras. Sahadeva had two wives Draupadi and Vijaya. Draupadi was the common wife of Pandavas while Vijaya was his own wife.
        Due to Pandu's inability to bear children (because of the curse of Rishi Kindama), Madri had to use the boon given to Kunti Devi by Sage Durvasa to give birth, who invoked the Ashwini Kumaras to beget Nakula and Sahadeva.

Later, Pandu died due to his Kindama's curse when he attempted to make love with his wife. Madri handled her children to Kunti and committed sati. Kunti raised him along with his brothers in Hastinapura with love and care. It is believed that Sahadeva was Kunti's favourite son in spite of not being her biological son. It is also believed that Sahadeva was an incarnation of Shukra, the guru of asuras.

Sahadeva and his brothers went to Hastinapura where they were instructed by Drona and Kripa in weapons. He mastered his skills in fencing and axe fighting. He also acquired the Nitishastra from Brihaspati, Guru of the Devas.</p>

        <p>Draupadi also referred as Panchali and Yajnaseni, is the tragic heroine, one of the central characters and the common wife of the Pandavas in the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. She is described to be the most beautiful woman of her time and was prophesied to bring a major change in the future.

Draupadi and her brother, Dhrishtadyumna, were born from a yajna organized by King Drupada of Panchala. Arjuna, one of the five Pandava, won her hand in marriage, but she married the five brothers because of her mother-in-law's misunderstanding. After facing problems created by her polyandry, she became the empress of Indraprastha. She had five sons, one from each Pandava, who were collectively addressed as the Upapandavas. After Yudhishthira, the emperor of Indraprastha, performed the Rajasuya, he was invited to play a gambling game in Hastinapura. After he lost Draupadi in the game, she was humiliated by the Kauravas, Shakuni and Karna. When Dushasana tried to disrobe her, Krishna saved her.

Later she and her husbands were sent on exile for 13 years with the last year being an incognito. While spending the exile, Jayadratha tried to kidnap and molest her. For incognito, Draupadi disguised herself as a maid and served Sudeshna, queen of Matsya. Kichaka, the general of the kingdom, tried to molest her, but was killed by Bhima. After the Kurukshetra War, the revenge for her humiliation was taken, but she lost her father, brothers and her five children. At the end of the epic, Pandavas and Draupadi retired to Himalayas and walked to heaven. Because of her partiality towards Arjuna, Draupadi was the first one to fall on the way.

Draupadi's story has been an inspiration for various arts and performances. In Literature, there are many books based on her life. In Hinduism, she is extolled as one of the panchakanya ("five virgins"), archetypes of female chastity whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited. In some parts of the sub-continent, Draupadi is not only regarded as a powerful lady, but a goddess too.</p>
